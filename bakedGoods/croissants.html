                  </p>
                  <p>Ingredients:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>500g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>70g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>10g salt</li>
                    <li>25g fresh yeast</li>
                    <li>250ml whole milk</li>
                    <li>250g unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Instructions:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, and salt. Crumble the yeast into the bowl and mix well.</li>
                    <li>Heat the milk until it is lukewarm. Add the milk to the bowl and mix until a dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic. Form the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise for 1-2 hours, until it has doubled in size.</li>
                    <li>Turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it out into a rectangle, about 1cm thick.</li>
                    <li>Cut the butter into thin slices and arrange them over two-thirds of the rectangle, leaving a border around the edges.</li>
                    <li>Fold the unbuttered third of the dough over the middle third. Fold the remaining third over the middle, as if you were folding a letter. Pinch the edges of the dough together to seal.</li>
                    <li>Turn the dough 90 degrees and roll it out again into a rectangle. Fold the dough again in the same way as before.</li>
                    <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Cut the chilled dough into triangles. Roll each triangle into a croissant shape and place it on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the croissants with beaten egg.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the croissants are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Enjoy your fresh Croissants!</p>
